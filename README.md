# The-Game-of-War
The Game of War using Object Oriented concepts in Java

Description:
This program uses Object Oriented concepts to simulate the Game of War n number of times. It will collect and return statistics on the games after the simulation 
is complete. 

The Game of War is a 2 player card game in which the players start out with 26 unique cards from a deck of 52. The players each draw 3 cards at a time and take
the average of the cards. The player with the higher average collects all cards in play. If the player only has 2 cards remaining, they will use the card with 
the higher value. This goes on until one player reaches 52 cards and is declared the winner. If the players tie, a "War" will ensue. The players will each draw 
one more card and the player with the higher value wins the War.
